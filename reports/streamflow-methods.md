## Streamflow Measurement Methodology 

In natural streams, continuous measurement of stream discharge is not feasible. Instead, an indirect approach was employed: river height (stage) was continuously measured at a gauging station using a pressure transducer, and periodic discharge measurements were taken across a range of potential stages to develop a stage-discharge rating curve. A detailed description of the measurement methods can be found in [Korver et al. (2020)](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4231/2022/essd-14-4231-2022.pdf).

Pressure transducers were installed in fall 2013 at watershed 708, and in fall 2014 at the other watersheds. Low flow measurements were manually obtained using the velocity-area method, with either a Swoffer Current Velocimeter or a Sontek Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. For stream flows typically greater than 0.5 m³/s, the salt dilution method was used—either manually (dry salt) or remotely (beginning in fall 2015) with a fully automated system. The automated salt dilution system (auto-salt) releases pre-defined volumes of salt solution at specific water stages, with two electrical conductivity sensors placed downstream to measure the salt wave. Data are available in near real-time via the Hakai Telemetry Network (www.hakai.org/technology/#science-1).
General Data QC and Analysis

Stage-discharge rating curves are dynamic and can shift over time due to changes in river channel morphology, often resulting from flood events. As such, these rating curves are regularly updated, especially after high-flow events.

Each discharge measurement is assigned a relative uncertainty, based either on fluctuations in the flow velocity profile (for the area-velocity method) or on uncertainties in the volume of salt solution, the resolution of the EC sensor, and the sensor calibration factor (for the salt dilution method). Measurements with uncertainties greater than 20%, those with noisy or malfunctioning conductivity sensors, or those with high uncertainties in stage monitoring are excluded from further analysis. The remaining stage-discharge measurements are plotted using LOESS regression, which accounts for scatter in the data and accommodates multi-section rating curves. The uncertainty of derived discharge data is quantified by plotting confidence intervals (CI) around the rating curve. These CIs are derived from 500 LOESS curve fitting results applied to a randomized set of stage-discharge measurements, identifying the maximum and minimum error values (Coxon et al., 2015). LOESS regression is preferred over previous fixed power-law methods because it does not assume a predefined curve shape, allowing it to fit data more precisely. Additionally, LOESS-derived CIs offer more realistic results, as the prior CI algorithm, designed for linear functions, required log transformations that led to unrealistic CI values—small at low flows and large at high flows.

This discharge time-series is based on 5-minute average stage measurements, which undergo Quality Control (QC), flagging, and correction as necessary. Data gaps are filled, and noisy or faulty data are corrected, with the corrected values marked with an ‘EV’ flag (Estimated Value). Suspicious data points that cannot be corrected are flagged with an ‘SVC’ (Suspicious Value Caution). All other data points are flagged as ‘AV’ (Accepted Value). QC flags assigned to stage data are automatically applied to the corresponding 5-minute discharge calculations. Discharges greater than the highest measured value are assigned an additional ‘SVC’ flag, as extrapolating beyond the set of measurements is highly uncertain and may lead to significant over- or underestimation of discharge.
