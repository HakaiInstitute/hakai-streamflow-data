# Archived Datasets
## Overview

- Since 2022, all streamflow datasets have been hosted on this GitHub repository, which includes both current and archived data. Prior to 2022, datasets were published as standalone packages and accessed through the Hakai Metadata Catalog via Google Drive links, each with its own DOI. While older datasets are still available in this repository, they are no longer updated and should primarily be used for attributing appropriate authorship. For consistency and convenience, it is recommended to use the data directly from the /data folder in this repository. Archived datasets are also linked below for ease of access.
